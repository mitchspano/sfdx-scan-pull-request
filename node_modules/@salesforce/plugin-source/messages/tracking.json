Use with extreme caution. \n\nResets local and remote source tracking so that the CLI no longer registers differences between your local files and those in the org. When you next run force:source:status, the CLI returns no results, even though conflicts might actually exist. The CLI then resumes tracking new source changes as usual.\n\nUse the --revision parameter to reset source tracking to a specific revision number of an org source member. To get the revision number, query the SourceMember Tooling API object with the force:data:soql:query command. For example:\n $ sfdx force:data:soql:query -q \"SELECT MemberName, MemberType, RevisionCounter FROM SourceMember\" -t",
