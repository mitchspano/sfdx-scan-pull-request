We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations.\n\nValidates the deployed metadata and runs all Apex tests, but prevents the deployment from being saved to the org.\nIf you change a field type from Master-Detail to Lookup or vice versa, that change isn’t supported when using the --checkonly parameter to test a deployment (validation). This kind of change isn’t supported for test deployments to avoid the risk of data loss or corruption. If a change that isn’t supported for test deployments is included in a deployment package, the test deployment fails and issues an error.\nIf your deployment package changes a field type from Master-Detail to Lookup or vice versa, you can still validate the changes prior to deploying to Production by performing a full deployment to another test Sandbox. A full deployment includes a validation of the changes as part of the deployment process.\nNote: A Metadata API deployment that includes Master-Detail relationships deletes all detail records in the Recycle Bin in the following cases.\n1. For a deployment with a new Master-Detail field, soft delete (send to the Recycle Bin) all detail records before proceeding to deploy the Master-Detail field, or the deployment fails. During the deployment, detail records are permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and cannot be recovered.\n2. For a deployment that converts a Lookup field relationship to a Master-Detail relationship, detail records must reference a master record or be soft-deleted (sent to the Recycle Bin) for the deployment to succeed. However, a successful deployment permanently deletes any detail records in the Recycle Bin.",
    "deployDir": "The root of the directory tree that contains the files to deploy. The root must contain a valid package.xml file describing the entities in the directory structure. Required to initiate a deployment if you don’t use --zipfile. If you specify both --zipfile and --deploydir, a zip file of the contents of the --deploydir directory is written to the location specified by --zipfile.",

    "jobId": "The job ID (id field value for AsyncResult) of the deployment you want to check. The job ID is required if you haven’t previously deployed using Salesforce CLI. If you deploy using Salesforce CLI and don’t specify a job ID, we use the ID of the most recent metadata deployment.",
    "testLevel": "Specifies which level of deployment tests to run. Valid values are:\nNoTestRun—No tests are run. This test level applies only to deployments to development environments, such as sandbox, Developer Edition, or trial orgs. This test level is the default for development environments.\nRunSpecifiedTests—Runs only the tests that you specify in the --runtests option. Code coverage requirements differ from the default coverage requirements when using this test level. Executed tests must comprise a minimum of 75% code coverage for each class and trigger in the deployment package. This coverage is computed for each class and trigger individually and is different than the overall coverage percentage.\nRunLocalTests—All tests in your org are run, except the ones that originate from installed managed and unlocked packages. This test level is the default for production deployments that include Apex classes or triggers.\nRunAllTestsInOrg—All tests in your org are run, including tests of managed packages.\nIf you don’t specify a test level, the default behavior depends on the contents of your deployment package. For more information, see “Running Tests in a Deployment” in the Metadata API Developer Guide.",

When ignoreWarnings is set to false, success is set to false, and the warning is treated like an error.\nThis field is available in API version 18.0 and later. Prior to version 18.0, there was no distinction between warnings and errors. All problems were treated as errors and prevented a successful deployment.",
    "zipFile": "The path to the .zip file of metadata files to deploy. You must indicate this option or --deploydir.If you specify both --zipfile and --deploydir, a .zip file of the contents of the deploy directory is created at the path specified for the .zip file.",
    "verbose": "Indicates that you want verbose output from the deploy operation.",
    "validatedDeployRequestId": "Specifies the ID of a package with recently validated components to run a Quick Deploy. Deploying a validation helps you shorten your deployment time because tests aren’t rerun. If you have a recent successful validation, you can deploy the validated components without running tests. A validation doesn’t save any components in the org. You use a validation only to check the success or failure messages that you would receive with an actual deployment. To validate your components, add the -c | --checkonly flag when you run 'sfdx force:mdapi:deploy'. This flag sets the checkOnly='true' parameter for your deployment. Before deploying a recent validation, ensure that the following requirements are met:\n1. The components have been validated successfully for the target environment within the last 10 days.\n2. As part of the validation, Apex tests in the target org have passed.\n3. Code coverage requirements are met.\n     - If all tests in the org or all local tests are run, overall code coverage is at least 75%, and Apex triggers have some coverage.\n     - If specific tests are run with the RunSpecifiedTests test level, each class and trigger that was deployed is covered by at least 75% individually.",

    "soapDeploy": "Deploy metadata with SOAP API instead of the default REST API. Because SOAP API has a lower .ZIP file size limit (400 MB uncompressed, 39 MB compressed), Salesforce recommends REST API deployment. This flag provides backwards compatibility with API version 50.0 and earlier when deploy used SOAP API by default."
