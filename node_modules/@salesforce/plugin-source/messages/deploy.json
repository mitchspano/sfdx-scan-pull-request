  "description": "deploy source to an org\nIMPORTANT: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations.\n\nUse this command to deploy source (metadata that’s in source format) to an org.\nTo take advantage of change tracking with scratch orgs, use \"sfdx force:source:push\".\nTo deploy metadata that’s in metadata format, use \"sfdx force:mdapi:deploy\".\n\nThe source you deploy overwrites the corresponding metadata in your org. This command does not attempt to merge your source with the versions in your org.\n\nTo run the command asynchronously, set --wait to 0, which immediately returns the job ID. This way, you can continue to use the CLI.\nTo check the status of the job, use force:source:deploy:report.\n\nIf the comma-separated list you’re supplying contains spaces, enclose the entire comma-separated list in one set of double quotes. On Windows, if the list contains commas, also enclose the entire list in one set of double quotes.\n If you use the --manifest, --predestructivechanges, or --postdestructivechanges parameters, run the force:source:manifest:create command to easily generate the different types of manifest files.",
