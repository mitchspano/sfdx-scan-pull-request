  "description": "authorize an org using an SFDX auth URL stored within a file\nThe SFDX auth URL must have the format \"%s\". NOTE: The SFDX auth URL uses the \"force\" protocol, and not \"http\" or \"https\". Also, the \"instanceUrl\" inside the SFDX auth URL doesn't include the protocol (\"https://\").\n\nYou have three options when creating the auth file. The easiest option is to redirect the output of the `sfdx force:org:display --verbose --json` command into a file. For example, using an org you have already authorized:\n\n    $ sfdx force:org:display -u <OrgUsername> --verbose --json > authFile.json\n    $ sfdx auth:sfdxurl:store -f authFile.json\n\nThe resulting JSON file contains the URL in the sfdxAuthUrl property inside of a results object. NOTE: The `force:org:display --verbose` command displays the refresh token only for orgs authorized with the web server flow, and not the JWT bearer flow. \n\nYou can also create a JSON file that has a top-level property named sfdxAuthUrl whose value is the auth URL. Finally, you can create a normal text file that includes just the URL and nothing else.",
