Values specified on the command line override values in the configuration file. Specify a configuration file or provide key=value pairs while creating a scratch org or a sandbox. When creating scratch orgs, —targetdevhubusername (-v) must be a Dev Hub org. When creating sandboxes, the --targetusername (-u) must be a production org with sandbox licenses. The —type (-t) is required if creating a sandbox.\n\n",
