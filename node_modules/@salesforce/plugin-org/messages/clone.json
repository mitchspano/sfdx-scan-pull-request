  "description": "clone a sandbox org\nThere are two ways to clone a sandbox: either specify a sandbox definition file or provide key=value pairs at the command line. Key-value pairs at the command-line override their equivalent sandbox definition file values. In either case, you must specify both the \"SandboxName\" and \"SourceSandboxName\" options to set the names of the new sandbox and the one being cloned, respectively. \n\nSet the --targetusername (-u) parameter to a production org with sandbox licenses. The --type (-t) parameter is required and must be set to \"sandbox\".",
