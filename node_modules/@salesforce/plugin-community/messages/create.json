Name and values are case-sensitive. See 'ExperienceBundle' in the Metadata API Developer Guide for more information.\n\nWhen you execute this command, it creates the site in preview status, which means that it isn't yet live. After you finish building your site, you can make it live.\n\nIf you have an Experience Builder site, publish the site using the sfdx force:community:publish command to make it live.\n\nIf you have a Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce site, activate the site to make it live by updating the status field of the Network type in the Metadata API. Alternatively, in Experience Workspaces, go to Administration | Settings, and click Activate.\n\nFor Experience Builder sites, activating the site just sends out a welcome email to site members.",
