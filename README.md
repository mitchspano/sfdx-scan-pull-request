# sfdx-scan-pull-request

Runs sfdx-scanner on a pull request or individual commit and generates in-line comments with the findings.

![Example](images/sfdx-scan-pull-request.png)

## Inputs

## `category`

Categor(ies) of rules to run.

## `engine`

Engine(s) to run.

## `eslint-env`

JSON-formatted string, overrides ESLint's default environment variables.

## `eslintconfig`

Location of eslintrc config to customize eslint engine.

## `pmdconfig`

Location of PMD rule reference XML file to customize rule selection

## `severity-threshold`

Throws an error when violations of specific severity (or more severe) are detected.

## `strictly-enforced-rules`

A JSON string which contains the rules which will be strictly enforced regardless of their priority. Enforced rules are identified by their engine, category, and rule name.

## `target`

Optionally provide this to scan a whole directory instead of just the diff. If the action is run on a push, `target` will be respected; because GitHub does not allow the uploading of comments during a PR run for a file that hasn't been changed on the latest commit for that PR, this option is ignored when running for a pull request (in favor of just scanning the diff, as it would if this option wasn't supplied).

## `tsconfig`

Location of tsconfig.json file

## `report-mode`

Details which way to report issues back to GitHub, can be either:

- `check-runs` - Shows findings as annotations on the PR (default)
- `comments` - Shows findings as comments

## `delete-resolved-comments`

When set to true, will delete resolved comments from a PR. Defaults to `false`. Will do nothing unless `report-mode` is set to `comments`

## Example usage

```
name: Static Analysis
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install SFDX CLI and Scanner
        run: |
          npm install sfdx-cli -g
          sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/sfdx-scanner

      - name: Run SFDX Scanner - Report findings as comments
        uses: mitchspano/sfdx-scan-pull-request@v0.1.11
        with:
          pmdconfig: ruleset.xml
          severity-threshold: 4
          strictly-enforced-rules: '[{ "engine": "pmd", "category": "Performance", "rule": "AvoidDebugStatements" }]'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Note the global installation of the SFDX cli - alternatively, you can use:

```
- name: Install SFDX CLI and Scanner
  run: |
    npm install sfdx-cli
    npx sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/sfdx-scanner
```

for that step.
